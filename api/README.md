This package contains files for each task. Each task will have its own class and all classes can inherit class 1 (if common functionality is required).

File helpers.py will have functions that may be common for all/set of classes. If you are working on a task and think a functionality may be used by other tasks (example sorting an array), please put it into helpers.py.
